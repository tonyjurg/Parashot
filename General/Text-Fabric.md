# Text-Fabric

## What is Text-Fabric
Text-Fabric is a powerful Python library and framework designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. Text-Fabric was developed by [Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda). The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).
