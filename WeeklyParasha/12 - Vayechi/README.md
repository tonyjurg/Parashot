Parasha Vayechi ("and he lived") is the final portion of the Book of Genesis. It recounts the closing moments of Jacob's life as he blesses his sons and imparts his final wishes and prophecies upon them, including the notable blessings to Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Jacob requests to be buried in the Cave of Machpelah alongside his ancestors, emphasizing the importance of the family burial place an the land. The parasha also describes Jacob's death and the elaborate mourning and burial processions.
