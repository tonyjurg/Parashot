## Summary

Parasha Miketz ("at the end") continues the story of Joseph in Egypt. It begins with Joseph, now a high-ranking official, interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, which predict seven years of plenty followed by seven years of severe famine. Impressed by his wisdom, Pharaoh appoints Joseph as governor, giving him authority over the land of Egypt to manage the forthcoming crisis. The portion also follows the reunion of Joseph with his brothers, who come to Egypt seeking food during the famine. Unrecognized by his brothers, Joseph tests their integrity by placing a silver cup in Benjamin's sack, leading to a series of tense and emotionally charged encounters. These events set the stage for the intricate unfolding of their family's fate, ultimately guiding them toward reconciliation and the preservation of their lineage.
