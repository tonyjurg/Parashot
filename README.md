# Parashot

Digital Humanities for the weekly Parasha (Torah portion of the week). The tools in this repository are based upon the [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis (BHSA)](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa), a Text-Fabric representation of the Hebrew Bible with linguistic annotations, created by the [Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer (ETCBC)](https://etcbc.nl/) at the VU Amsterdam.

## The weekly parasha

A “parasha” is a section of the Torah divided for weekly reading. Each parasha encompasses a specific portion of text, and there are 54 parashot (plural for parasha) covering the entire five books of the Torah, ensuring the entire Torah is read over the course of a year. This weekly reading cycle, known as the Torah portion, is integral to Jewish liturgy and communal worship, providing a structured approach to studying and reflecting upon the Torah’s teachings. The information on this site is structured along these parashot.
